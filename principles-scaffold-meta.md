# Scaffolding the principles

Meta: Scaffolding the principles: Let's create a scaffold on these concerete learnings.

* (Also see [./cpp-glossary.md])
* These are not design patterns. More than that.
* Abstractions to organise LTM lernings, Implicit knowledge.
   * To: consolidate them, make them explicit, make them tangible (almost like concrete).
   * Start with C++ principles. But they are almost univdersal (aat least across C++ and Java, until next paradigm disruption. Some not? In that case, find their roots in GIL).


* Substitution failure is not an error (SFINAE)
* RAII
