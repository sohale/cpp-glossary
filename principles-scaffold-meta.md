# Scaffolding the principles

Meta: Scaffolding the principles: Let's create a scaffold on these concerete learnings.

* (Also see (./cpp-glossary.md##phrases))
* These are not design patterns. More than that.
* Abstractions to organise LTM lernings, Implicit knowledge.
   * To: consolidate them, make them explicit, make them tangible (almost like concrete).
   * Start with C++ principles. But they are almost univdersal (aat least across C++ and Java, until next paradigm disruption. Some not? In that case, find their roots in GIL).

## C++ concrete acronyms
(initialism)
### SFINAE
* Substitution failure is not an error (SFINAE)
### RAII
* RAII (resource acquisition is initialization)

Also known as Constructor Acquires, Destructor Releases (CADRe) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization](see)

A sub-type of RAII is SBRM (Scope-based Resource Management). [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization](link)

### CADRe
Constructor Acquires, Destructor Releases. Another name for RAII. See [RAII]
