# Scaffolding the principles

Meta: Scaffolding the principles: Let's create a scaffold on these concerete learnings.

* (Also see (./cpp-glossary.md##phrases))
* These are not design patterns. More than that.
* Abstractions to organise LTM lernings, Implicit knowledge.
   * To: consolidate them, make them explicit, make them tangible (almost like concrete).
   * Start with C++ principles. But they are almost univdersal (aat least across C++ and Java, until next paradigm disruption. Some not? In that case, find their roots in GIL).

## C++ concrete acronyms
* Substitution failure is not an error (SFINAE)
* RAII

### C++ concepts
* Constructor Acquires, Destructor Releases'' (CADRe) see RAII
* Scope-based Resource Management'' (SBRM) see RAII
