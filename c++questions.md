## Questions
### What is the best for Kruskal's algorithm?
(priority queue? heap? anyu sorted/max retrieval?) no. Or perhaps needs to get sorted first.

### Three ways of defining order.
[here](fusharblog.com/3-ways-to-define-comparison-functions-in-cpp/). Comparator. operator<()

### Why `()` is done when a *functor* is used.

### Use an example of `less<T>`

## Rando questions
Why `*` in code? `set<int, bool (*)(int, int)> s(cmp);`

## Minor

* Why is `stable_sort()` necessary?  `stable_sort()` versus `sort()`. 
* What algorithm does `sort()` use?
* Is `sort()` done inplace? How is it different to Python's?
