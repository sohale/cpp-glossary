Actors:
CLIENT

RESOURCE HOLDER

concepts:
Access channel.

pre (provisional)
and next iterations.
conception:

First pass:
Issuer: CLIENT
Triggerer: User.

Conception: nothing. (Just user's click.)

Accumulation flow (story):
1. User name (this user requested): pre... of the "bit".
2. Content: Which Scopes requested. User profile. Return URL.

The bit:
1. Who done it.
2. This user has clocked on it.
3. I have a proof for it.
(Maybe: informs: 4. Auth-server has added its stamp of aproval. Added to it. not sure.).

Ultimate:
1. The bit (provisional and approved dont add content. But add an existence-based flag. state-based?).
1.5 Proof of the bit.
2. Scopes (provisional, and approved.)

The Ultimate is not the final ulitmate outcome of the "whole" OAuth-process thing.
There is also ACCESS thing (distributed object. Not object. Entity).
But at then is there only one thing?
The joint and complete state (like pure state in QM) consists of not only the ACCESS-CODE with that context-object in the Auth server/resource holder, but also Client.
It is a Closure (in the sense in Mathematics).

Client's user is different to Sertver's client.

But at a higher level they refer to the same object. (closure, but at a higher level.).

OAuth assumes there ais one physicaql user (identity). BVut in reality it may be not. For example: It works for the user.
Or does not have access to all that user has. (cool! like SUDO. No further granularity possible).
But I could not say it well. But it's OPK.
