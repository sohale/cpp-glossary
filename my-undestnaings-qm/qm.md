# Quantum Mechanics
My QM book.

(My) intro to Quantum Mechanics:

How I charaacterise (intention/telos/reason-for-existeence/apriori-essense) this book:
* The way I see it.
* With my own confusions.
* This is my substitute long-term-memory (extended mind, a mind helper).

### I usually confuse:
Or recur.

* Hermician and unitary matrices
* Block sphere and Pauli matrices
* L.A: Unitary, Real, etc Matrices.

### (uncategorised)
Highlights:
* Hermician matrices associate with observables.


#### Hermician matrices
Each observable is a [Hermitian] matrix. Since most times Hermitian matrices don't [commute], obervables don't commute. Then uncertinty in derived* from this. (I say derived, that is, I try to avoid to sya that objevctiveerly-results from it).

Properties:
* Equality with the adjoint (conjugate transpose)
* unitarily diagonalizable
* real eigenvalues

And of course:
* is square
* diagonal elements must be real

A bit confusing:
* Every Hermitian matrix is a [normal matrix].
* `A` `A^H`=`A` `A`=`A^H`
* can be diagonalized by a [unitary matrix]
