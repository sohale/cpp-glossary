# Quantum Mechanics
My QM book

## (My) intro to Quantum Mechanics:

* The way I see it.
* With my own confusions.

### I usually confuse:
Or recur.

* Hermician and unitary matrices
* Block sphere and Pauli matrices
* L.A: Unitary, Real, etc Matrices.

### (uncategorised)
#### Hermician matrices
Hermician matrices associate with observables.
